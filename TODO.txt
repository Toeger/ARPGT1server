Plan for the network:
    Encryption
        Need to verify packet origin to avoid people messing with other people
        Use RSA with the server's certificate to send half a random AES key to the server
        Server sends half an AES key back encrypted with the first half
        Server and client combine client-half and server-half to the same AES key
        Encrypt all packets with per-user AES key
        Need to resend lost packets
    Alternative
        Make a login server that uses SSL to pass the AES key
        TCP would handle lost packets
        SSL would handle encryption
    Issues
        Figure out how to send floats. Convert to string? Convert to int?
        Figure out why the close function is not found.
